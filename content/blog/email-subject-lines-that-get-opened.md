# 7 Email Subject Line Formulas That Actually Get Opened

Your email is brilliant.

The copy is tight. The offer is strong. The design is perfect.

But if the subject line doesn't get opened, none of it matters.

**Subject lines are 50% of email success.** Maybe more.

After writing 1,000+ email campaigns for DTC brands, I've learned what works. Here are 7 formulas that consistently drive opens—without resorting to clickbait.

## 1. The Curiosity Gap

Give them just enough to make them curious—not enough to satisfy that curiosity.

**Examples:**
- "The mistake we made last week..."
- "You're not going to believe what happened"
- "I wasn't supposed to tell you this"
- "This changes everything we thought about [topic]"

**Why it works:** Humans hate incomplete information. If you open a loop, we're wired to close it.

**Warning:** Don't abuse this. If your email doesn't deliver on the curiosity, you'll train people to ignore your subject lines.

## 2. The Specific Benefit

No vague promises. Tell them exactly what they'll get.

**Examples:**
- "Save £47 on your next order"
- "Get 23% more sleep (tested by 1,000 customers)"
- "This takes 5 minutes and cuts your workload in half"
- "3 ways to double your open rates by Friday"

**Why it works:** Specificity = credibility. "Save money" is vague. "Save £47" is real.

**Pro tip:** Numbers draw the eye. Use them whenever you can.

## 3. The Question They're Already Asking

Your customers have questions. Answer them in the subject line.

**Examples:**
- "Why aren't your ads working?"
- "How do I get my kid to wear earplugs?"
- "Should you send emails on weekends?"
- "What's the best time to launch a product?"

**Why it works:** If they're already asking this question, your email becomes instantly relevant.

**How to find these:** Look at your customer service emails, support tickets, and social media comments. Those are your subject lines.

## 4. The Objection Buster

Address the reason people haven't bought yet.

**Examples:**
- "Yes, they actually stay in"
- "No, you don't need design skills"
- "It's easier than you think"
- "This works even if you have zero experience"

**Why it works:** You're removing friction before they even open the email.

**When to use this:** Perfect for cart abandonment emails or re-engagement campaigns.

## 5. The Deadline (That's Real)

Urgency works—but only if it's honest.

**Examples:**
- "Sale ends tonight at midnight"
- "Last call: 6 hours left"
- "Your cart expires in 2 hours"
- "Final chance to join (we're closing the doors)"

**Why it works:** FOMO is real. Deadlines force decisions.

**The non-negotiable rule:** Honor your deadlines. If you say midnight, stick to midnight. Otherwise, you train people to ignore your urgency.

## 6. The Pattern Interrupt

Say something unexpected. Break the pattern of boring subject lines.

**Examples:**
- "I'm shutting down the business"
- "This was a terrible idea"
- "Please don't buy this"
- "We screwed up"

**Why it works:** Your inbox is full of "New Product Launch!" and "20% Off Sale!" Pattern interrupts stand out.

**Warning:** Only use this if your email delivers on the intrigue. Don't trick people.

## 7. The Personal Note

Write like it's from a real person to a real person.

**Examples:**
- "Quick question for you"
- "Thought you'd want to see this"
- "Hey [Name], noticed you left this behind"
- "Following up on your order"

**Why it works:** It doesn't look like marketing. It looks like a message from a friend.

**Pro tip:** Personalization (using their name or referencing their behavior) increases opens by 20-30%.

## How to Choose the Right Formula

Not every formula works for every email.

**Use curiosity** for content-heavy emails (blog posts, guides)
**Use specific benefits** for promotional emails (sales, offers)
**Use questions** for educational or problem-solving content
**Use objection busters** for abandoned cart or re-engagement
**Use deadlines** for time-sensitive offers
**Use pattern interrupts** sparingly (they lose power if overused)
**Use personal notes** for transactional or behavioral triggers

## Subject Line Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Oversell
"AMAZING DEAL YOU CAN'T MISS!!!" = immediate delete

### ❌ Don't Use ALL CAPS
It looks like spam. And it probably goes to spam.

### ❌ Don't Lie
If you say "last chance" and it's not really the last chance, you lose trust.

### ❌ Don't Bury the Lead
Get to the point fast. Subject lines aren't essays.

### ❌ Don't Ignore Mobile
60% of emails are opened on mobile. Keep it under 50 characters or it gets cut off.

## The Testing Rule

**You don't know what works until you test it.**

I've seen subject lines I loved bomb completely.
I've seen throwaway lines become the winner.

Your audience decides. Not you.

### How to Test:
1. Write 3-5 variations
2. Send each to a small segment (10-15% each)
3. Wait 2-4 hours
4. Send the winner to the remaining 60-70%

Most email platforms (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, etc.) have built-in A/B testing. Use it.

## Real Examples from My Work

Here are some subject lines I've written that performed well:

**For Loop Earplugs (Product Launch):**
- "Your kid's new secret weapon for school" (28% open rate)
- "Finally. Earplugs that actually stay in." (32% open rate)
- "Is your child overwhelmed by noise?" (25% open rate)

**For F1 Arcade (Event Campaign):**
- "Your date just got faster ⚡" (31% open rate)
- "Dinner & drinks? Try racing & champagne." (29% open rate)
- "A new kind of speed dating" (27% open rate)

**For SaaS Company (Re-engagement):**
- "We noticed you haven't logged in..." (22% open rate)
- "Still struggling with [problem]?" (26% open rate)
- "Your account is about to expire" (35% open rate—transactional)

## Your Next Step

Good subject lines aren't about tricks. They're about clarity.

- **Tell them what's inside**
- **Make it relevant**
- **Be specific**
- **Test everything**
- **Honor your promises**

And remember: The subject line's job isn't to sell. It's to get the email opened.

The email's job is to sell.
