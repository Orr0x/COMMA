# The Complete Product Launch Copywriting Checklist

Product launches don't fail because the product is bad.

They fail because nobody knows the product exists. Or understands what it does. Or cares enough to buy it.

That's a copy problem.

I've worked on product launches for brands like Loop Earplugs (Â£120M+ e-commerce) and early-stage startups. The difference between launches that work and launches that flop? **Preparation.**

Here's every piece of copy you need ready before launch day.

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2-4 Weeks Before)

The goal: Build anticipation. Get people excited before you have anything to sell.

### 1. Teaser Campaign Copy

**What it is:** Short, mysterious messages that hint at what's coming without revealing everything.

**Where you need it:**
- Email teaser sequence (3-5 emails)
- Social media teasers
- "Coming soon" landing page

**Example (Loop Earplugs Kids Launch):**
> "Something smaller is coming. ðŸ¤«
>
> (Hint: It's not for you. It's for your kids.)"

**Pro tip:** Build a waitlist. People who join your waitlist are 3x more likely to buy on launch day.

### 2. Waitlist Landing Page

**What it is:** A single page that explains just enough to get people to sign up.

**Copy you need:**
- Headline (what's coming)
- 3-5 bullet points (why they should care)
- Waitlist form copy
- Social proof (if you have it)
- FAQ (optional but helpful)

**Formula:**
```
[Product Name] is coming [Date]
[One sentence explaining what it is]

Join the waitlist and get:
â†’ Early access
â†’ Launch day discount (optional)
â†’ First to know when it drops

[Waitlist form]
```

### 3. Social Media Teaser Posts

**What you need:**
- 5-7 teaser posts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Countdown posts ("3 days until...")
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Founder story (why you built this)

**Hook formulas:**
- "We've been working on this for [X months]..."
- "This doesn't exist yet. But it should."
- "You asked for it. We built it."

### 4. Email Teaser Sequence

**Recommended: 3-5 emails**

**Email 1:** The announcement ("Something new is coming")
**Email 2:** The problem ("Here's why we built this")
**Email 3:** The sneak peek ("Want to see it first?")
**Email 4 (optional):** Behind the scenes
**Email 5:** Final teaser before launch

## Phase 2: Launch Day

The goal: Convert anticipation into sales.

### 5. Product Page Copy

**This is your most important asset.** Get this wrong and nothing else matters.

**Structure:**
- **Hero headline** (what it is + main benefit)
- **Subheadline** (who it's for or how it works)
- **Product description** (benefits, not features)
- **Key features** (3-5 main selling points)
- **How it works** (step-by-step if needed)
- **Social proof** (testimonials, reviews, press)
- **FAQs** (address objections)
- **CTA** (buy now, add to cart, etc.)

**Example hero section:**
> **Loop Engage Kids**
> The first earplugs designed for children ages 4-12
>
> Reduce noise by 16dB without blocking out important sounds like teachers or parents.

### 6. Launch Announcement Email

**Subject line ideas:**
- "It's here: [Product Name]"
- "Finally. [Product] is available."
- "[Product Name] just launched (and it's already selling fast)"

**Email structure:**
- Open with excitement
- What it is
- Why it matters
- What makes it different
- CTA (shop now)
- PS: Add urgency if appropriate

### 7. Product Descriptions (Short & Long)

**Short description (for ads, social, quick listings):**
- 1-2 sentences
- Main benefit + key feature

**Long description (for product page):**
- 3-5 paragraphs
- Tell a story
- Paint the before/after
- Address objections

### 8. Launch Ads Copy

**Platforms to prepare:**
- Meta (Facebook & Instagram)
- Google Shopping
- TikTok (if relevant)
- Google Search (if you have budget)

**For each platform, write:**
- 5-10 headline variations
- 3-5 body copy variations
- Multiple CTA options

**Ad angle ideas:**
- Problem-focused: "Tired of X?"
- Solution-focused: "Introducing the only X that..."
- Results-focused: "Join 10,000 people who..."
- Contrarian: "Stop doing X. Try this instead."

### 9. Social Media Launch Posts

**Day 1 posts across all channels:**
- Announcement post (carousel with product details)
- Founder/team announcement
- Video demo (if possible)
- Customer testimonial (if you have early reviews)
- Story series (Instagram, Facebook)

**Copy formula:**
> Today's the day. [Product Name] is officially available.
>
> [One paragraph explaining what makes it special]
>
> [Link to buy]

### 10. Press Release (If Relevant)

**For B2B or newsworthy launches:**
- Headline
- Subheadline
- Opening paragraph (who, what, when, where, why)
- Quote from founder/CEO
- Product details
- Availability info
- Company boilerplate

## Phase 3: Launch Week (Days 2-7)

The goal: Sustain momentum. Most launches die after day 1.

### 11. Follow-Up Email Sequence

**Email 1 (Day 2):** "In case you missed it..."
**Email 2 (Day 4):** Customer story or early review
**Email 3 (Day 6):** Address objections or FAQs
**Email 4 (Day 7):** Last call (if you have urgency)

### 12. Social Proof Content

**Now that it's live, gather:**
- Customer photos/videos
- Testimonials
- Unboxing content
- Press mentions
- Influencer reviews

**Write copy to accompany each piece of social proof.**

### 13. Retargeting Ad Copy

**For people who visited but didn't buy:**
- "Still thinking about [Product]?"
- "Left something behind?"
- "Here's what people are saying about [Product]"

### 14. FAQ Page Updates

**Add launch-specific FAQs:**
- When will it ship?
- Is it in stock?
- What's included?
- How does it compare to [competitor]?

### 15. Thank You / Confirmation Emails

**Order confirmation:**
- Celebrate their purchase
- Set expectations (shipping, etc.)
- Offer support
- Upsell (if appropriate)

## Phase 4: Post-Launch (Week 2+)

The goal: Turn buyers into evangelists. Build long-term demand.

### 16. Post-Purchase Email Sequence

**Email 1 (Shipped):** Tracking info + excitement
**Email 2 (Delivered):** "How's it working for you?"
**Email 3 (1 week later):** Ask for review
**Email 4 (2-3 weeks):** Educational content or tips

### 17. Review Request Copy

**Email or in-app message:**
> Loving your [Product]? We'd love to hear about it.
>
> Leave a review and help other [customers] discover what you already know.
>
> [Review button]

### 18. Case Study / Customer Story

**For one standout customer:**
- Their problem before
- Why they chose your product
- The result they got
- Quote from them

**Use this for:**
- Blog post
- Social media
- Future ads
- Product page testimonial

### 19. Educational Content

**Blog posts, videos, guides:**
- "How to get the most out of [Product]"
- "5 ways to use [Product]"
- "[Product] vs [Alternative]: Which is better?"

### 20. Referral Program Copy

**If you have referrals:**
- "Give [discount], Get [discount]"
- "Love [Product]? Share it with friends."
- Email copy, landing page, share messages

## Bonus: Copy You Might Need

### 21. Influencer Outreach

**If you're doing influencer marketing:**
- Outreach email template
- Product description (for them to post)
- Key messages (what you want them to say)
- Discount code messaging

### 22. Customer Service Scripts

**For common questions:**
- "When will it ship?"
- "Can I return it?"
- "How does it compare to [competitor]?"

**Having scripts ready keeps messaging consistent.**

### 23. Internal Launch Email

**For your team:**
- What's launching
- Key messages
- Where to find assets
- How to talk about it

**Everyone on your team should know how to describe your product.**

## The Most Important Thing

Having all this copy ready doesn't guarantee success.

But not having it guarantees missed opportunities.

I've seen launches lose momentum on day 2 because they didn't have follow-up content ready. I've seen brands burn through ad budgets testing headlines that should have been written weeks earlier.

**Preparation wins.**

Write your launch copy before you need it. Test it. Refine it. Have it ready.

When launch day comes, you want to be celebratingâ€”not scrambling to write copy.
